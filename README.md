## Purpose
This website was created for Milestone Project 3 in the Software Development Course for Code Insitute. The languages used in the project are the languages which have been thought in the course up until now, which include, HTML, CSS, JS, User Centric Design, Interactive Front End Development, Python Essential and Backend Development.

The live website can be found [here](https://ailisc97.github.io/Milestone_Project_3/)

## Resturant Finder Website

![Website Mockup](assets/images/)

Resturant Finder, is a website in which users can find a resturant by serching by location or tags, which is how to describe the resturant for example: cheap, spicy, Italian and expensive. Users can also have accounts where they can add, delete and edit resturants. This website is great for friends, family and couples who dont know where they want to eat and now they can easily find out where they want to go with this handy new website. This project is for the Milestone 3 project which has python and backend tecnology added in the form of MongoDB and Heroku.

## User Experience Design

### User stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time user,I want to easily and quickly navigate the website to look up resturants.
* As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by tags to find a resturant.
* As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by location to find a resturant.
* As a First Time user, I want to access the site links.


#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning User, I want to know how to contact the creators of this website.
* As a Returning user, I want to set up an account so I can add resturant(s) to the website.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
* As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can remove resturant(s) to the website.
* As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can edit resturant(s) to the website.


### Structure
All Pages will have a Navigation bar (using Bootstrap) at the top of the Webpage that allows the User to select resturants and to search different resturants.
The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user,I want to easily and quickly navigate the website to look up resturants.

The search function for the User to search different resturants.
> As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by tags to find a resturant.
> As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by location to find a resturant.

In the Footer there will be links to find the site links on the page.
> As a First Time user, I want to access the site links.

The Footer will also inform the user how to get in touch with the website creators.
>As a Returning User, I want to know how to contact the creators of this website.

Users who set up an account would want to add, delete and edit the page so the other users can find new and exciting resturants to visit in the future.
>As a Returning user, I want to set up an account so I can add resturant(s) to the website.
>As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can remove resturant(s) to the website.
>As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can edit resturant(s) to the website.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The background colour used is white. The nav bar and the footer are a cream colour. The resturant card has the background in white, the words in black and a picture of the resturant.

In the form page (signup.html) the form it's self is a white with black.

In the footer the background is cream and when hovered over the media links and phone and email number it changes to dark blue.

####  Typography
The font on the website is **Roboto**. This font was off Google Fonts.

#### Wireframes
Index.html page, Contact page, Create-Resturant page, Edit-Resturant page, Resturant Page, Sign Up, Sign In<br>

### Limitations
The biggest limitation I faced was the connection to Mongo DB ,for the longest time it wouldnt connect, but once I hard coded it in it worked fine.

## Technologies
  
* HTML
	* This project uses HTML as the main language used for the Website.
* CSS
	* This project uses CSS to style the Website.
* JavaScript
    * This project uses JS to have the game being able to function and the sendEmail which sends me an email when someone clicks  submit on the form.
* Python
	* This project uses CSS to connect to the background.
* [Mongo DB](https://getbootstrap.com/)
	* Mongo DB stored the infromation given from the website, and saved as a database.
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
	* Heroku is used for the deployment of the website.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
	* The Bootstrap framework is used for Navigation bar, the carousel and the contact us form.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
	* Google fonts are used throughout the project to import the *Roboto* font.
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    *GitPod is used to develop the website and where the code for the website was wrote.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
	* GitHub is the site used to store the code for the Website and [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is used for the deployment of the live site.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
	* Git is used as software to commit and push code to the GitHub repository where the source code is stored.
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
	* Google chromes built in developer tools are used to inspect page elements in various different sized. It also helped debug issues and test different CSS styles.
* [Techsini](http://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php)
    * tecnisih.com Multi Device Website Mockup Generator was used to create the Mock up image in this README
* [HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
    * HTML Checker is an important website to make sure there are no errors in the HTML code.
* [W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

## Testing

### Test Strategy 

#### Summary 

Testing is required on Milestone Project 2, Ping Pong Game for Interactive Frontend Development.

The testing performed will be on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing to be done on Google Chrome web browser. Testing on the game will be letting the computer win and getting the user to win.The game should be fully responsive.


In the Navigation bar the links should take the user to the correct html page. The Home page will be redirected to index.html.

On the Results.html page the form must not be submitted until the required information is inputted into the fields. And an email should be recieved to my personal gamil account. The email template is as seen below.

![Email](assets/images/EmailTemplate.PNG)

Validation of inclusion for all features included in the Structure of the Website / Wireframes must be performed.


The live Project can be found [here](https://ailisc97.github.io/Milestone_Project_2/).</br>

#### High Level Test Cases 
![Test Cases](assets/images/HighLevelTest.PNG)

#### Out of Scope  
* There is no way to save forms - forms come via email.

### Test Results
Testing results can be found [here](assets/images/TestCases.xlsx)<br>
This results are a .xlsx file and will need excel to open. <br>
All Pages were run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), there was no errors.<br>
CSS Stylesheet was run through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri),there was no errors.
JS Page was ran through [JShint](https://jshint.com/), there was no errors.

The user can send off more then just one score and the user will be contacted if their score is high enough to win the stickers, as all the relivent contact details have been required and sent on.

### Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing
The website is not mobile first and when the page is put into a mobile first device using google inspect the game is laggy and doesnt work.

Another issue is that the form doesnt auto clear.

## Deployment

### Project Creation
I created a repository in Github and called it Milestone_Project 2, I selected to add a README into the project. When I went into the repository, I clicked the GitPod button on the top right and that opened GitPod for me. I used Git to add, commit and push all my saved work from GitPod.

* git add . -This would add all the work from the different pages to the GitHub.
* git add index.html -Would only save the work from Index.html
* git pull - This would pull the GitHub version of my project.
* git commit -m "MESSAGE" - This would commit the added work from git add . and leave a message beside it.
* git push- This pushed the added work to GitHub
* python3 -m http.server - This opened the website on the right hand side of the page.
