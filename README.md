## Purpose
This website was created for Milestone Project 3 in the Software Development Course for Code Insitute. The languages used in the project are the languages which have been thought in the course up until now, which include, HTML, CSS, JS, User Centric Design, Interactive Front End Development, Python Essential and Backend Development.

The live website can be found [here](https://ailisc97.github.io/Milestone_Project_3/)

## Resturant Finder Website

![Website Mockup](assets/images/)

Resturant Finder, is a website in which users can find a resturant by serching by location or tags, which is how to describe the resturant for example: cheap, spicy, Italian and expensive. Users can also have accounts where they can add, delete and edit resturants. This website is great for friends, family and couples who dont know where they want to eat and now they can easily find out where they want to go with this handy new website. This project is for the Milestone 3 project which has python and backend tecnology added in the form of MongoDB and Heroku.

## User Experience Design

### User stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time user,I want to easily and quickly navigate the website to look up resturants.
* As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by tags to find a resturant.
* As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by location to find a resturant.
* As a First Time user, I want to access the site links.


#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning User, I want to know how to contact the creators of this website.
* As a Returning user, I want to set up an account so I can add resturant(s) to the website.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
* As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can remove resturant(s) to the website.
* As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can edit resturant(s) to the website.


### Structure
All Pages will have a Navigation bar (using Bootstrap) at the top of the Webpage that allows the User to select resturants and to search different resturants.
The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:
> As a First Time user,I want to easily and quickly navigate the website to look up resturants.

The search function for the User to search different resturants.
> As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by tags to find a resturant.
> As a First Time user, I want to easily and quickly navigate serch by location to find a resturant.

In the Footer there will be links to find the site links on the page.
> As a First Time user, I want to access the site links.

The Footer will also inform the user how to get in touch with the website creators.
>As a Returning User, I want to know how to contact the creators of this website.

Users who set up an account would want to add, delete and edit the page so the other users can find new and exciting resturants to visit in the future.
>As a Returning user, I want to set up an account so I can add resturant(s) to the website.
>As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can remove resturant(s) to the website.
>As a Frequent user, I want to set up an account so I can edit resturant(s) to the website.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The background colour used is white. The nav bar and the footer are a cream colour. The resturant card has the background in white, the words in black and a picture of the resturant.

In the form page (signup.html) the form it's self is a white with black.

In the footer the background is cream and when hovered over the media links and phone and email number it changes to dark blue.

####  Typography
The font on the website is **Roboto**. This font was off Google Fonts.

#### Wireframes
Index.html page, Contact page, Create-Resturant page, Edit-Resturant page, Resturant Page, Sign Up, Sign In<br>

### Limitations
The biggest limitation I faced was the connection to Mongo DB ,for the longest time it wouldnt connect, but once I hard coded it in it worked fine.
